This is my Vulneribility Assesment Projeckt.

I used VMW workstation, and have a Windwos 10 virtual machine ( All Firewalls turned off and Windows Defender too, and , I also used Tenable Nessus to do the scan, and after I will try to manually fix the vulnerabilities.

As We can see, we have found 5 medium and 1 low vulnerabilities and 31 info files.

So We are gonna have a look at the first medium vulnerability what is CVSS 6.5 Ip forwarding enabled.

Nessus already provide Solution, so we will follow that, for now.
![ip-forwarding-enabled](https://github.com/messor89/Portfolio/assets/52599741/40c1fcb6-c2b2-4981-bf37-0ab12e0fe773)

So We did it, changed 'IPEnableRouter' to 0 under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters what you can find in the registry editor.

Our second Medium Vulnerability is JQuery 1.2 < 3.5.0 Multiple XSS
![JQuery1 2-3 5 0MultipleXSS](https://github.com/messor89/Portfolio/assets/52599741/fedaca25-23a0-4e21-bdaa-f1c3b4901e7b)

This is an easy one, We just need to update the version. You can just go to the official website download it and because It is  JavaScript library you include and reference in your website's code via <script></script>.

Our third medium Vulnerability is SMB Signing not required

This one took a little longer to solve, as Windows 10 couldn't find gpedit.msc.

So in Powershell Administration mode, I run 2 commands:

sfc /scannow
DISM /Online/Cleanup-Image/RestoreHealth

and after I run a bat file, which created gpedit.msc.
![gpedit](https://github.com/messor89/Portfolio/assets/52599741/ff6012f5-6e88-43d2-9854-c2b9f0f9f71d)

After I have just found the policy and set it to "Enabled".

I made a Windows update which helped to resolve the following Vulnerabilities:
