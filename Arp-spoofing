This is my first Project, in Cisco Packet Tracer.

This is a projeckt topology for a Bank, which contains a Reception and an Office area, also provides free wifi for Quests. 
The Reception and the Office are separated for two different networks, which can reach each other and also the DNS server with the bank's website. 
Also there is an attacker machine, which broke the weak wpa password of the office wifi and will try to do an ARP spoofing attack.
